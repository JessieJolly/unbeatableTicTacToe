# Unbeatable_TicTacToe
A tictactoe where you never win, implemented using minimax algorithm

## Requirements
Make sure you have the pygame module along with Python. If not, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

` 
pip install pygame
`
## Instructions
It is a two-player game between the user and the computer. The computer is made 'smart' using the minimax algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the chance of the user to win while simultaneously maximizing the chance of the computer to win. Hence the computer never loses no matter how hard the user tries.

*In the home-screen the user is free to chose either X or O

*The user can play the game any nummber of times using the re-play feature

*Each game ends in a draw or the computer wins

*User gets the first chance always

## How to run
Copy the repo to your local device and simply execute the python file

`
python tictactoe.py
`

I'm just a beginner in programming, so I know there are better ways to implement some of these features. If you know an easier and more efficient way to do so, do let me know!
